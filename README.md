# A list of projects related to data 

This is a list of a small selection of projects I've worked on in the past related to data. The images link to the project sites. Note that this only includes *public* projects.

### _Show me the money_, a data project

In *Show me the money* I analysed the complete data of the three biggest peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms in the UK (Zopa, RateSetter, and Funding Circle) with almost 14 million loan parts. It provided the most comprehensive snapshot of the UK P2P market at the time of publication. We gained high-profile media coverage for this story and have direct evidence of change in the peer-to-peer sector.

### _What is a CSV? A case study of CSVs on data.gov.uk_, an elaborate blog post

A short project during my time at the Open Data Institute, where I analysed more than 20,000 links to CSV files on data.gov.uk. Results: only around one third turned out to be machine-readable. A typical CSV is between 1kb-1mb in size and has around eight columns. And I got to play around with [Gephi](https://gephi.org/).

###  _A survey on the uses of quantified self_, a survey and presentation

[presentation slides](https://github.com/londonqs/qs/blob/master/meetup-content/2014-02/Survey%20overview.pdf)



There is a lot more where this came from... Here is an example: a [book chapter](https://issuu.com/designacademy/docs/_05_stressedout_issuu/26).  


### The _anonymisation decision-making framework_, an online course

Together with the [UK Anonymisation Network](http://ukanon.net) and [Purple Guerrilla](https://www.linkedin.com/company/purple-guerrilla) I've managed and developed an online course as an introduction to anonymisation. The online learning aims to promote the decision-making framework and give data practitioners confidence when dealing with personal data.

### Benchmarking open data automatically, a technical report

A high-level overview of if and how we can evaluate and rank countries, organisations and projects, based on how well they use open data in different ways. As open data becomes more widespread and useful, so does the need for effective ways to analyse it.

### Open Rail Performance Indicator


### Academic and boring technical stuff

* Making [fast consensus clustering in R](https://github.com/statshero/consensusclustering
) possible with speed improvements of x60. This is an extension for the R package `clusterCons`. More information about the package can be found [here](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/clusterCons/index.html). It has now been removed, so I'm not sure what's going on.

### On data visualisation

* An introduction to the history of visualisation and many examples. Sadly it's hidden deep away on page 30 of an [OpenDataMonitor report](http://project.opendatamonitor.eu/wp-content/uploads/deliverable/OpenDataMonitor_611988_D2.3-Best-practice-visualisation,-dashboard-and-key-figures-report.pdf). I plan to make this more accessible in the future. 
    * `2013, visualisation, history, report, best-practice` 
* I run an R course on visualisation, in particular `ggplot2`.  
* A vain, self-referential [visualisation of temperature levels of 10 000 days](https://github.com/statshero/Weather_timeseries_BZ/blob/master/cal%2010000%20days.pdf) for my 10 000th day alive. 
    * `2013, R, ggplot2, time series, visualisation, pointless, fun`
* [SCHEME_TUFTE](https://ideas.repec.org/c/boc/bocode/s457285.html): Stata module to provide a Tufte-inspired graphics scheme
    * `2011, Stata, Tufte, visualisation, graphics`
* Some [templates](https://github.com/statshero/SPSS-tools) to make SPSS charts look more appealing
    * `2012, SPSS, visualisation, graphics, tools`


### Some more random fun projects, with data

* [A tutorial on how to import a HTML table into R](http://rpubs.com/statshero/opinion-polls). Actually, I find the visualisation part more interesting. 
* [Cleaning up](https://github.com/statshero/wine-cellar) the dataset from the [annual statement on the Government Wine Cellar](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/annual-statement-on-the-government-wine-cellar-for-the-financial-year-2013-to-14). Not a glamorous job but someone has to do it.
* When I jumped on the train to comment on [Piketty's Capital](https://theodi.org/blog/pikettys-capital-changed-the-global-discussion-around-inequality-because-it-uses-great-data-now-make-it-open), I made some suggestions on how to make his charts better. For example, in the style of the Economist.

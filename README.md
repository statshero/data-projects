# A list of data projects

This is a simple list of projects I've worked on in the past related to data.

## Show Me The Money, a data project

In *Show me the money* I analysed the complete data of the three biggest peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms in the UK (Zopa, RateSetter, and Funding Circle) with almost 14 million loan parts. It provided the most comprehensive snapshot of the UK P2P market at the time of publication. We gained high-profile media coverage for this story and have direct evidence of change in the peer-to-peer sector.

## The Anonymisation Decision-Making Framework, an online course

Together with the [UK Anonymisation Network](http://ukanon.net) and [Purple Guerrilla](https://www.linkedin.com/company/purple-guerrilla) I've managed and developed an online course as an introduction to anonymisation. The online learning aims to promote the decision-making framework and give data practitioners confidence when dealing with personal data.
